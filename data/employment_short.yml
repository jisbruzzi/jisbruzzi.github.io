            Nutrition app with many features.

            - Build the testing pipeline, using Gitlab for CI
            - Fully committed to the principles of the Agile, with constant communication and
            delivery of value

            Biggest achievements:
            - keeping the app reliable while shipping new features constantly and having no testers. I built a large e2e test suite to accomplish this.
            - Establishing an agile workflow with stakeholders that had no former experience with software development projects.
