            - A Chrome extension that is key to the company value proposition would break constantly which demanded overtime from several members of the team. I created unit tests and used them to refactor, which greatly increased its stability and reliability.
            - I made the chrome extension work in a wide variety of websites built with several different web technologies. My full-stack experience was a key factor to resolve these issues.
            - I carried out the development of multiple full redesigns of our main UI, which impacted every single one of our users, increasing engagement.
            - Full-stack development of complex reports. I was able to do some query optimizations and communicate with our DBA to suggest indexes.
            - I also carried out some optimizations and updates in our data pipeline.
            
            My biggest achievement was being able to adapt to new ways of working through multiple leadership changes and an acquisition.

      MVP for different industries. During this time I created 2 projects from scratch (including CI/CD, infrastructure, architecture):
    projects: 
        - name: 'Project: NDA: Nutrición en Acción'
          content: |
            Nutrition Suite. Main tasks:
            - Rewrite the application with flask, while keeping the previous database.
            - Build the testing pipeline, using Gitlab for CI
            - Fully committed to the principles of the Agile, with constant communication and
            delivery of value

            Biggest achievements:

            - Establishing an agile workflow with stakeholders that had no former experience with software development projects.
            
            **Stack:** python, flask, sqlalchemy, flask-admin, react, Gatsby, MaterialUI, vuejs, quasar, firebase, AWS, metabase.

          Critical politically-charged project that aimed to handle a significant amount of the executive branch budget. 
          During the presidential race, I fully developed a module that would provide transparency. I collaborated with the UX team to make it clear, usable and attractive. As a testament to how impactful the feature would have been, the module was disabled shortly after the ruling party lost the election.
