            - Maintain and improve an initially unreliable chrome extension that is key to our value proposition, allowing easy acces to our flagship products.
            - Full-stack development of complex reports, I was able to optimize the query in these cases to take advantage of existing indices (10x speedup).
            - Multiple full redesigns of the UI of one of our main products, where I collaborated with multiple stakeholders (UX designers, product owners, leadership) to push the project to the finish line.
            - Deploy advanced features of react-query and Material UI to improve user experience and styles
            - Advocate for the adoption of prettier, eslint.
            - Collaborate with leadership on the design of UI development patterns and building standards across teams.
            - Maintainance of our python data pipelines.
            - Some projects that pushed my knowledge of the web platform to its limits:
              - Fix challenging errors in the chrome extension that were related to specific stacks (e.g. shadow DOM, HTML over the wire, infinite scrolling)
              - A custom code tag that our customers would add to their websites. It required to be very lightweight vanilla js and had plenty of interactive features.
              - Web crawlers that automated data collection, this involved reverse-engineering third party websites.

            Nutrition app with many features.
            - Migrate an existing php app to flask.
            - Build the testing pipeline, using Gitlab for CI
            - Fully committed to the principles of the Agile, with constant communication and
            delivery of value

            Biggest achievements:
            - keeping the app reliable while shipping new features constantly and having no testers. I built a large e2e test suite to accomplish this.
            - Establishing an agile workflow with stakeholders that had no former experience with software development projects.
